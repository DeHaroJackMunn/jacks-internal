        The 3d object I have decided to make is a 3d object of the planet Saturn. 
The reason why I created this was because it was a simple object to make using Blender.
I used a sphere and a ring like shape around the sphere with a golden kind of colour to create the object. 
<br>
<br>
1.	The first step was creating the sphere and making the shading of the object smooth.
<br>
2.	The 2nd step was to add the ring like shape to the object and changing the segments of the ring so looks more like a ring. I then the ring around the sphere.
<br>
3.	The final step was to add the colour to the object and I had my final design.
