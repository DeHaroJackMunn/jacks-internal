            The tool that I used to create the website was Brackets. I started off with creating the first page of my website by creating the html page and the working on the css page. I would look for and errors on the page and once I was finished I would then move on to the 2nd page and apply the same to the 2nd html and css page and then to the 3rd page. When doing the first page, I was thinking about what kind of lines, shapes, fonts, colours and other things that would make my website look even better. 
            <br>
            <br>
            For my final web design, I used colours #ffffff for the fonts and the containers etc. and #000000 for the background colour.
            <br>
            <br>
            I used the Poiret One font for everything including the title, navigation bar and the texts. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The things that are on my website are:
            <br>
            •	Black and white colours
            <br>
            •	A font from Google fonts
            <br>
            •	2 containers on each page
            <br>
            •	A navigation box with the 2 other pages 
            <br>
            •	A 3D view of my object
